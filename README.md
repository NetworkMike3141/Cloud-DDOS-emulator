# Cloud-DDOS-emulator
FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. The purpose of this report is to describe and explain the development process of a cloud-based application that simulates a DDoS botnet. This was used to conduct attacks on two websites hosted on Cloudflare and AWS. The technologies used to build the application consisted of cloud computing and Docker containers. 
An iterative approach was applied while developing the simulator and two websites were built with the purpose of testing the system at the end of each stage. The development process started with the research of different DDoS tools and techniques that can be used to perform all types of DDoS attacks: Volumetric, Protocol-based, and Application Layer-based. A Docker image was then built for each one of the chosen tools. The image was added to AWS Elastic Container Registry and deployed in the cloud utilizing both launch types offered by AWS Elastic Container Service: EC2 launch and the serverless compute engine Fargate. 
Final testing was only possible with a 50-container deployment due to budget limitations. The results of the attacks on the two websites were measured by analysing page load time and ICMP reply time. The testing outcome revealed the DDoS attacks had no effect on the functionalities of the two websites. 
At the end of the report an analysis was conducted to find the techniques employed by the two cloud providers to mitigate the DDoS attacks that were carried out in this project.
